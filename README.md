# numpy_tic_tac_toe

A little exercise after a Sunday workshop focusing on numpy (2022/01/30) which I attended to revise and practice working with numpy arrays.  

At the end of the workshop we were asked to write a little game of tic tac toe, here is my attempt.
This was mostly meant as a quick excercise in numpy, functions, loops and organizing code rathen than proper game rather than a proper python project.

You can run this game in your terminal using:

    python tic_tac_toe.py
  
The file functions.py contains simple functions, each of them was meant to execute a crucial step in the game.
